This project implements algorithms to perform specific operations on a doubly linked list and a binary search tree (BST). For the doubly linked list, we provide an algorithm to find a specified node and swap it with its successor. For the binary search tree, we implement standard operations such as insertion, preorder traversal, sum calculation, and finding the k-th biggest element. Each section below explains the functionalities, algorithms, and runtime complexities.
